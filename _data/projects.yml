# CMPE243 Project
- project: Autonomous RC Car – CANster Truck
  role: CMPE243 Team Project
  duration: Feb, 2020 &mdash; May, 2020
  url: http://socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php/S20:_Canster_Truck
  description: To develop an autonomous RC Car which can navigate from the source destination to its selected destination using Sensors, Actuators and GPS.
  bullet_points: 
    - Each controller was designed as a self-contained module that handled specific tasks. 
    - Message passing between each node (SJTwo Board) was done over CAN (Controller Area Network) and messages were auto-generated using the CAN DBC format.
    - Primarily worked on the Geological Controller and interfaced the GPS, Bluetooth and Compass hardware.
    - Worked on the Haversine algorithm, Waypoints algorithm and the Driver Controller logic.

# TODO, Add CMPE220 Project

# CMPE240 Project
- project: Generate PUF using NAND Flash
  role: CMPE240 Team Project
  duration: Sept, 2019 &mdash; Dec, 2019
  # url: "#"
  description: Generate a Hardware based PUF/Secure Key by simulating Read and Write Disturb on a SLC NAND Flash.
  bullet_points:
    - NAND Flash K9F1G08U0E was bit banged using the B-L475E-IOT01A board.
    - Program Disturb was successfully recreated on the SLC Flash and the PUF was generated after running the Program Disturb for 10000 cycles.
    - IEEE based research paper was written and submitted for the CMPE 240 course.

# CMPE244 Project
- project: Infinity Mirror MP3 Player
  role: CMPE244 Team Project
  duration: Oct, 2019 &mdash; Dec, 2019
  url: http://socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php/F19:_Infinity_Mirror
  description: Create a MP3 Player with an LED Matrix and OLED Screen for output. A Music based game was to be created and playable on the LED Matrix.
  bullet_points:
    - OLED Drivers using the u8g2 library was written and tested on the in-house SJTwo Board (NXP 4078).
    - APDS-9960 Gesture Sensor and Accelerometer Sensor (MMA8452Q) drivers were written to create the music based game
    - Mobile application was created using Flutter and Bluetooth was used to send Accelerometer and Joystick sensor data to the SJTwo Board.

# Green Homes Project
- project: Green Homes Project
  role: Individual Developer
  duration: Dec, 2018 &mdash; Jun, 2019
  url: https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/green-homes-project
  description: Build an IoT based Plant Watering system that can be controlled remotely as well as perform watering tasks automatically
  bullet_points:
    - Successfully built and integrated the frontend (Mobile App), backend (Parse Server) and Slave devices (NodeMCU – ESP12E)
    - Backend systems were configured with ACLs to handle multiple clients using the same device as well as to add multiple slave devices under the same client.
    - Client (Mobile App) and Slave device had the ability to send and receive updates in real-time using the Parse Server Websocket integration.
    - Slave devices had RTC integrated to store alarm information and water the plant at a particular time during the day.
